# Interpreter Readme

## Interpreter.ts

This contains the main interpreter implementation code. We have an essential function `findCandidates` that converts the parser entity descriptions to a list of possible candidates in the Shrdlite world.

## Util.ts

This file contains functions we want access to in the planner as well as the interpreter.
